# my-photomath

Repository for the Photomath pre-interview assignment solution.


Current milestones:

- created a simple math dataset consisting of 600 hand drawn symbols.
- created a basic PyTorch model training and evaluation python file. 
- created a simple OCR using openCV.
- basic math parser functionality added     

To-do: 
- improve and automate the workflow.
- increase overall modularity and refactor
- connect the components (image input, OCR, ML digit recognition, math parser)
